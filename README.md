Simple file searcher script made in python

**how to use**:  
```py seek.py``` prints recursively all files of the script's current folder  
```py seek.py -h``` prints all possible flags

```py seek.py > files.txt``` prints to files.txt

### TODO:
- it is working in windows, have to test and adapt for linux too
